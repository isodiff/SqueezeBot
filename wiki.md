### nekos.life
Squeez uses **nekos.life** api to provide various sfw and nsfw gifs in japanese manga/anime style. It is being used in the `/img` command, both in the `interaction` and `request` subcommands. Currently, there is *no support for sending pornography* through the bot, but this feature will be considered in the future.
